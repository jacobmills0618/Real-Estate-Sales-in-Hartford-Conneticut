# Real-Estate-Sales-in-Hartford-Connecticut

Comprehensive analysis on Real Estate Sales using SQL and Python.   
   
# 🚀 Purpose

The purpose of this project was to demonstrate how SQL and Python can be used to analyze real-world data sets. To achieve this, I explored real estate sale prices and sale amounts in Hartford, Connecticut, and tied relevant context such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
   
   
# 🔍 Project Goals  
  
- Investigate missing value patterns and their correlations
- Determine and visualize trends in sale prices and sale amounts
- Interpret results using historical housing market context  
- Use trend data to predict potential prices and amounts in 2025

# 📈 Key Findings

- Decreases in sale amounts matching national housing market trends
- Increase in sale prices, possibly related to housing market rates
- Correlations between the COVID-19 Pandemic and Real Estate Sales in Hartford.
- Predictions for sale prices and amounts in 2025.

# Summary

I first began this project by addressing the large number of missing values in the dataset. Using SQL queries, I filtered and selected relevant columns of missing data to understand its context with the surrounding data.

Next, I categorized sale prices into price ranges ("Normal" vs. "Expensive") to avoid skewing my visuals. The results produced comprehensible patterns in both prices and sale amounts over time.

Following this, I then interpreted these patterns in the context of historical events, with specific regard to the global pandemic and historical housing market rates.

Finally, using observed changes over time, I created a basic prediction to estimate what 2025 real estate data might look like if current trends continue.

# ⚠️ Improvements 

- Unfortunately, I recognize that the dataset had to exclude a large portion rental properties, which makes up a significant percentage of the housing market. In the future, I would hope to include rental trends that complements my current analysis.

- Secondly, with more skills and experience, I think it would be nice to identify neighborhood-level affluence based on concentrations of high- and low-value properties.

- Finally, future work could also include geospatial analysis to map and visualize the properties across Hartford.
