# Real-Estate-Sales-in-Hartford-Conneticut

Comprehensive analysis of real estate sales using SQL and Python.   
   
# 🚀 Purpose

The purpose of this project was to demonstrate how SQL and Python can be used to extract, clean, and analyze real-world data sets. To achieve this, I explored real estate sale prices and sale amounts in Hartford, Connecticut, and tied relevant context such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
   
   
# 🔍 Project Goals  
  
- Investigate missing value patterns and their correlations
- Determine and visualize trends in sale prices and sale amounts
- Interprete results using historical housing market context  
- Use trend data to predict potential prices and amounts in 2025

# 📈 Key Findings

- Drops in sale amounts matching national housing trends
- Steady increase in sale prices, likely driven by housing market rates
- Correlations between the COVID-19 Pandemic and Real Estate Sales in Hartford.
- Predictions on sale prices and amounts in 2025.

# Summary

This project began by addressing the large number of missing values in the dataset. Using SQL queries, I filtered and selected relevant columns of missing data to understand its context and correlation with surrounding data.

Next, I categorized sales into price ranges ("Normal" vs. "Expensive") to avoid skewed visualizations. The results of which produced clear patterns in both price and sale amounts over time.

I then interpreted these patterns in the context of historical events, with specific regards to the global pandemic and historically low mortgage rates in 2020–2021.

Finally, using observed year-over-year changes, I created a basic prediction to estimate what 2025 real estate data might look like if current trends continue.

# ⚠️ Improvements 

- The dataset lacked information on rental properties, which excluded a significant portion of the housing market. Including rental trends would provide a more complete picture.

- I would like to expand the analysis by identifying neighborhood-level affluence, based on concentrations of high- and low-value properties.

- Future work could also integrate geospatial analysis to map and visualize property value distribution across Hartford.
